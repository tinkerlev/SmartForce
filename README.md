## üß© Tips for Better Accuracy

- A successful login is usually detected by:
  - A word like `logout`, `dashboard`, `bienvenido`
  - A redirect (HTTP 302)
- Test on sites with real forms (not just marketing pages)
- If you're not getting results, try a more active page

You can also route traffic through TOR:
```bash
python3 smart_bruteforcer.py https://example.com --proxy
```
(Ensure the TOR service is running on port 9050)
